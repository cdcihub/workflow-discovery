## Purpose of this note

Technologies develop rapidly, and not all astronomers can keep up. More importantanly, it is smart of them not to chase the latest fashion, since it may take a lot of effort with little benefit.
Furthermore, common, reusable developments compete with specialized fit-for-purpose ad-hoc work.

Building automation reacting on sky events is, in principle, a very common practice in Transient Astronomy.
